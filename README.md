# Google-calendar-automation

<h2>Purpose of this project</h2>
<p>I was tasked to track bookings of specific locations in a camp which required me to use the google calender to add new bookings
I thought that it would be a good idea to create a simpler UI to book an event in the calender using customTkinter and Google calender API.</p>
